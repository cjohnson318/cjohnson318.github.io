In this post, I'll go further in depth into learning (some) French, based on
what I've learned from learning Spanish.

## Part 0 - être, to be ##

This is a great way to state obvious things like a child.

| Subject-Verb | Object       | Note           |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| je suis      | étudiant     | identity       |
| tu es        | française    | nationality    |
| il est       | grands       | physical trait |
| elle est     | intelligents | personal trait |
| on est       | à Paris      | location       |
| nous sommes  | fatigué      | temprary state |
| vous êtes    |              |                |
| ils sont     |              |                |
| elles sont   |              |                |

The pronoun *on* is an informal way to say "we", and it takes the third person
singular. The pronoun *vous* is a polite way to say "you", and it takes the
second person plural, like *y'all* in English.
