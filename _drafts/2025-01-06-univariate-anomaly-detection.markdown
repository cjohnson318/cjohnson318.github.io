## Dynamic Time Warping

This "aligns" time series in time. In practice, subsets of timeseries may be
shifted, stretched, or compressed in time. Maybe you're working on a smart
speaker application and you want pick up words that are spoked slower than
usual, for the benefit of the smart speaker. DTW libraries attempt to "align"
one time series, based on a reference time series.

## Autoencoder

An autoencoder is a type of neural network that is used for dimensionality
reduction, or compression. There are two pieces to this, the encoder, which
takes the original input and compresses it into a lower dimensionality,

## Minkowski Distance

This is can be used to highlight outliers multidimensional data.
