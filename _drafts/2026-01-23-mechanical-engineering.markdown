This post collects some topics that are prerequisites for a masters in
mechanical engineering, namely,

  - CIVE 260 - Statics*
  - CIVE 261 - Dynamics*
  - CIVE 360 - Mechanics of Solids
  - MECH 324 - Dynamics of Machines
  - MECH 325 - Machine Design
  - MECH 337 - Thermodynamics
  - MECH 342 - Fluid Mechanics for Mechanical Engineers
  - MECH 344 - Heat and Mass Transfer

## Statics

Unlike Mechanics of Solids, Statics assumes all objects are rigid. This means
we assume they do not deform or change shape regardless of how much force you
apply.

### Vector Algebra

### Free Body Diagram

These diagrams isolate a structure from the elements around it, and replace
those elements with forces.

### Method of Joints

### Method of Sections

### Centroids and Moments

### Friction

### Shear and Bending Moments
