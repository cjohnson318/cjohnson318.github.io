Over the last 5 years Iâ€™ve been running Miro Solutions with several sub-contractors to provide programming consulting services to businesses that need distributed systems, web apps, dashboards, and other custom data tools. My mission is to help my clients improve their workflow, productivity, and decision-making by creating user-friendly and data-driven solutions. I have over 12 years of experience in web development, data visualization, and machine learning, using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Django, etc. I love learning about new industries, new technologies, and creating custom tools to empower others.

Running my own software consulting business has helped me develop deep technical expertise, client management and project leadership skills. While I've thrived on the autonomy and challenges of consulting, I miss collaborating with a diverse team of passionate experts and so have decided to seek a more traditional role where I can be challenged and grow in new ways.

Project highlights from the last 10 years are: 

  - Designing and building a multi-tenant trucking logistics platform, on web and mobile, supporting automated driver dispatch, driver location, geofencing, on-site inventory management, and invoicing.
  - Leveraging ML/LLM tools for the energy sector to clean data, estimate subsurface formations, and audit basin-wide data sets.
  - Building an internal web app to store, markup, and analyze three dimensional NMR data cubes for petrophysicists.
  - Creating a distributed system at Apple to collect electronic discovery data for the legal department. For several years, all of Apple's eDiscovery data flowed through this system.
  - Building a dead-reckoning system for a sewer inspection robot using a digital camera, a BeagleBone, and a Python script using OpenCV. This was necessary because GPS, wheel encoders, and accelerometers all provided inaccurate data.
