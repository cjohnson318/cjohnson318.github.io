## Guide to Fats

### Saturated Fat

**State at Room Temperature:** Solid (e.g., butter, lard, coconut oil).

**Sources:** Primarily animal products: fatty meats (beef, pork), full-fat dairy (cheese, cream, butter), and tropical oils (coconut oil, palm oil).

**Health Impact:** Associated with raising LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels, which can increase the risk of heart disease.

**Healthy Limit:** Most major health organizations recommend limiting saturated fat intake to less than 10% of total daily calories. For a 2,000-calorie diet, this translates to less than 22 grams (g) per day. Note: Some organizations, like the American Heart Association, recommend aiming for an even lower limit of less than 6% of daily calories (or about 13 g/day) for individuals with high cholesterol or heart disease risk.

### Unsaturated Fat

Unsaturated fats are generally considered the "healthy fats." They are further divided into two categories:
  - **Monounsaturated Fat (MUFAs)** Olive oil (the primary fat in the Mediterranean diet), avocados, almonds, cashews, and pecans. Helps lower LDL ("bad") cholesterol and maintain HDL ("good") cholesterol.
  - **Polyunsaturated Fat (PUFAs)** Walnuts, sunflower seeds, flaxseeds, corn oil, soybean oil, and fatty fish (salmon, mackerel) which contain Omega-3s. Essential fats the body cannot produce. They help reduce overall cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

There is no specific gram limit for the healthy limit of unsaturated fats. Instead, the goal is to replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats while keeping your total fat intake within a healthy range (typically 20-35% of total calories). Maximize intake of MUFAs and PUFAs, particularly those high in Omega-3 fatty acids.

### Trans Fat

**State at Room Temp:** Solid or semi-solid (e.g., stick margarine, shortening).

**Sources:** Artificially Produced Trans Fat: Commercial baked goods (cookies, cakes, crackers), fried foods, and certain processed snacks.

**Health Impact: Worst for the heart.** Trans fats raise LDL ("bad") cholesterol while simultaneously lowering HDL ("good") cholesterol, increasing the risk of heart disease more than any other fat.Healthy Limit (Trans Fat)The consensus among health experts is that trans fat should be consumed at the absolute minimum level possible:

**Goal:** 0 grams per day.

**Recommendation:** Limit intake to less than 1% of total daily calories.For a 2,000-calorie diet, this translates to less than 2.2 grams per day.

Since many countries (including the U.S.) have banned or severely restricted the use of artificial trans fats, they are far less common now. However, watch for the phrase "partially hydrogenated oil" in ingredient lists, which indicates the presence of artificial trans fat.
