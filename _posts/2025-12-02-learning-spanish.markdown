I've been learning Spanish for a few years. A cousin got married in Mexico
City, and I thought I could learn enough Spanish to get around and communicate,
and I *basically* acheived my goal. I learned enough to communicate on the spot
without memorizing stock phrases. I had a LOT of difficulty understanding spoken
Spanish, but I was able to say things, and ask questions, and I could read a
paperback with about 80% comprehension without translation.

I think a key to this (highly qualified) success was learning enough grammar and
irregular verbs right away so that I could absorb the rest of the language, 
without constantly getting tripped up over tricky words. 


## Verbs


### Two Dirty Dozens

There isn't a quick way to learn a language outside of complete immersion, and
a sense of urgency. Short of that, you can get strategic. I started by
identifying some key verbs, about two dozen. I tried to strike a balance
between essential verbs and irregular verbs. Luckily, there's a lot of overlap
there.

The first dozen focuses on the most essential and irregular verbs. The second
dozen supplements this list with other essential verbs, and verbs that are have
unusual conjugations, or stem changes. Barron's has a list of 55 verbs that they
consider canonical in the sense that they cover most of the irregularity in
Spanish. I leaned on that list when building the second dozen.

| 1st Dozen | 2nd Dozen |
|-----------|-----------|
| ir        | saber     |
| ser       | pensar    |
| estar     | salir     |
| tener     | seguir    |
| querer    | traer     |
| hacer     | caer      |
| poder     | sentir    |
| poner     | morir     |
| venir     | oír       |
| ver       | oler      |
| decir     | caber     |
| dar       | conducir  |
| haber     | deber     |

It turns out that when my daughter was learning to read, she came home with a
list of "Trick Words", or sight words, that she should know by sight without
sounding out, and it was almost exactly this first dozen words, in different
tenses, plus some pronouns, articles, and prepositions.


### Tenses

Once I had some useful verbs, I started learning about tenses, and moods, and
all of the different ways to use verbs. Here is a list of verb forms, tenses
and verb phrases. You don't need to focus on all of this at once, prioritize
the present, preterite, and shortcut future. Next, look at the imperfect,
command form, and present and past perfect tenses. Then fill in the gaps with
the rest of the tenses.

Why are there two past tenses, the preterite and the imperfect? The preterite
is the simple past, for completed, atomic actions, like, "I ran this morning".
The imperfect is for habitual past actions, like, "I used to run". Thinking of
the imperfect as saying "used to" is a great way to keep from over-thinking it.

It actually makes a lot of sense STARTING with the simple past tense, the
preterite. Knowing how to say "I ate", "I made coffee", and in general reporting
about completed past actions is arguably more useful than talking about what
you are doing right now in the present.

The present is versatile; it can be used to talk about what you're
doing, what you usually do, and what you're about to do. The preterite is
important because it is more irregular than the other past tense, the imperfect.
The imperfect is importand because it's super easy, and a quick win. It only has
three irregular verbs, but they're all in the first dirty dozen above. The
shortcut future is a way to talk about the future without learning the future
tense yet. The command form has irregularities, which come up in books and
movies, and it's a good intro to the subjunctive. The present perfect and past
perfect tenses are ways to say "I have done this", or "I had done that". Reading
will go a lot faster when you don't get stuck on *había* every time it comes up.

| Tense | Formula | Example | Translation |
|-------|---------|---------|-------------|
| present participle | -ando, -iendo | hablando | speaking |
| past participle | -ado, -ido | hablado | spoken |
| **present** | AR: -o, -as, -a, -amos, -an; ER/IR: -o, -es, -e, -(e/i)mos, -en | hablo | I speak |
| **preterite** | AR: -é, -aste, -ó, -amos, -aron; ER/IR: -í, -iste, -ió, -imos, -ieron | hablé | I spoke |
| **imperfect** | -aba, -ía | hablaba | I used to speak |
| future | infintive + haber present tense endings: -é, -ás, -á, -emos, -án | hablaré | I will speak |
| **shortcut future** | present of ir + a + infinitive | voy a hablar | I am going to speak |
| conditional | infintive + -ía endings | hablaría | I would speak |
| **command** | there's a lot going on here | habla, hable Ud. | speak! |
| subjunctive | swap the endings | hable | I speak |
| imperfect subjunctive | -ara, -iera | hablara | I used to speak |
| **present perfect** | present of haber + past participle | he hablado | I have spoken |
| **past perfect** | imperfect of haber + past participle | había hablado | I had spoken |
| future perfect | future of haber + past participle | habré hablado  | I will have spoken |
| conditional perfect | conditional of haber + past participle, then present subjunctive | habría hablado... | I would have spoken |
| present progressive | present of estar + present participle | estoy hanblando | I am speaking |
| past progressive | imperfect of estar + present participle | estaba hablando | I was speaking |
| past perfect progressive | imperfect of haber + estado + past participle | había estado hablado | I had been speaking |
| subjunctive present perfect | present subjunctive of haber + past participle | haya hablado | I had spoken |
| subjunctive past perfect | imperfect subjunctive of haber + past participle | hubiera hablado  | I would have spoken |
| shortcut subjunctive past perfect | imperfect of ir + a + infinitive | iba a hablar | I was going to speak |

Just learning the six highlighted tenses for the first dozen verbs above is a
lot of work, but it captures a significant portion of the complexity in Spanish.


### Imperative and the Subjunctive

Commands are important because you hear them a lot more than you read them,
there are a number of irregular commands (remember: *Ven DiSal Haz Ten VePons*),
and they prepare you for using the subjunctive, since both forms often swap the
endings of -AR and -ER/IR verbs. If you go to a Mexican restaurant you'll hear,
"Ven!", come in. If you're around kids, you'll hear adults say "ponla de nuevo",
put it back. You'll hear commands all the time in person and on TV. Once you're
comfortable with commands, then the subjunctive will be second nature. The
subjunctive is a *mood* that expresses a strong desire, a strong emotion, which
isn't that different from a command when you think about it.

| Command | Example | Translation | Explanation |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Affirmative Tú | ¡habla! ¡come! | speak!, eat! | third person singular of the present tense |
| Negative Tú, and all other commands | ¡tengas! ¡no vengas! | here! don't come! | the subjunctive; take the first person, present tense, yo-form, drop the "o", and use the "other" ending |

## Pronouns

After learning verbs and tenses, you should look at how pronouns are used.
Spanish uses the pronouns in multiple distinct ways, and it can be very
confusing. First there are direct and indirect object pronouns, present in
constructions like, "He gave it to him", then there are pronouns used by
reflexive verbs, that are kind of like saying "I shower (myself)", and then
there are times that the pronoun "se" is used in the passive voice like "se
habla español", "spanish is spoken", or "se renta", "for rent".


### Direct and Indirect Object Pronouns

In 2007 Tim Ferriss published a list of sentences he uses to learn a language
in [How to Learn (But Not Master) Any Language in 1 Hour](https://tim.blog/2007/11/07/how-to-learn-but-not-master-any-language-in-1-hour-plus-a-favor/).
This post has become internet-famous in the language acquisition community,
[here](https://www.realfastspanish.com/grammar/13-sentences-need-know-guide-spanish-grammar-hacking),
[here](https://learnitalianwithlucrezia.blog/2017/04/10/13-sentences-to-speak-any-language-not/),
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/4uzgsr/tim_ferriss_13_sentences_in_french/),
and several versions of his sentences have spread through the internet.

| Sentence                   | Example                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| The apple is red           | La manzana es roja           |
| It is John’s apple         | Es la manzana de John        |
| I give John the apple      | Yo doy a John la manzana     |
| We give him the apple      | Nosotros le damos la manzana |
| He gives it to John        | Él la da a John              |
| She gives it to him        | Ella se la da a él           |
| Is the apple red?          | ¿Es la manzana roja?         |
| The apples are red         | Las manzanas son rojas       |
| I must give it to him      | Debo darsela a él            |
| I want to give it to her   | Quiero darsela a ella        |
| I’m going to know tomorrow | Voy a saber mañana           |
| I can’t eat the apple      | No puedo comer la manzana    |
| I have eaten the apple     | He comdio la manzana         |

Although there's no official version of the list, about half of it is always
using direct and indirect objects and their pronouns. The rest of it focuses on
forming a decalrative sentence, some verb phrases, auxilliary verbs, like "have",
negation, and ways to talk about the past and future. So, it's not "learning a
language in an hour", but it's a good use of your first couple of hours
learning a language, and a good reminder to spend time becoming an object
pronoun ninja.


### Reflexive Verbs

English doesn't have reflexive verbs in the same sense that Spanish does. It's
kind of like saying "myself" or "yourself" after a verb. The best way to get a
handle on these verbs is using a few of them regularly until your brain gets
used to the idea.

| Verb | Example | Translation |
|-|-|-|
| ducharse | me duché | I showered |
| cepillarse | me cepillé los dientes | I brushed my teeth |
| acostarse | me acosté | I went to bed |
| dormirse | me dormí | I went to sleep |
| despertarse | me desperté | I woke up |
| levantarse | me levanté | I got out of bed |

You shower (yourself), you brush (your own) teeth, you sleep (yourself), you can
see how the "myself" trick falls apart very quickly after "shower yourself". You
just have to push through this. Also notice that "levantarse", get up, is
related to "levantar", pick up, or raise. Pay attention to how the reflexivse
form of a verb may have a different meanind that it's non-reflexive cousin.

Here are some level two reflexive verbs.

| Verb | Example | Translation |
|-|-|-|
| darse cuenta | me de cuenta de que llegué tarde | I realized that I was late |
| ponerse | me puse enojado | I got mad |
| ponerse | me puso los calectines | I put on socks |
| volverse | se volvió loco | He went crazy |
| irse | me voy ahorito | I'm going/leaving now, I'm headed out now |
| olvidarse | se me olvidó | It/they forget themselves to me, I forgot |
| caerse | se me cayó el vaso | I (accidentally) dropped the glass. Lit. The glass fell from me | 
| romperse | se romió el vaso | The glass broke |
| acabarse | se acabó el café | The coffee ran out |


### The Impersonal and the Passive Voice

Things like, "se vende", "for sale", and "se habla español", "spanish is spoken
(here)" are examples of using the impersonal passive reflexive *se*. This is
almost like saying "one" does something, or "people" do this or that, or some
unspecified "they" do something. Like everything here, once you really
internalize a few examples, it's easier to pick up the rest.

The passive voice allows you to use sentences talking about a thing
where the subject doesn't exist, or is not important. A good example is, "the
streets are swept on Thursdays." This is passive or impersonal because it
doesn't matter in this scenario who is doing the street sweeping. Obviously it
is someone, but it doesn't matter in this situation. Another example is "the
house was built last year." The house isn't the subject here, it is the object,
the thing that was built. The subject, who or what built the house, is not
mentioned.

In these cases, we use a conjugated *ser + past participle* construction. For
"the streets are swept on Thursdays" we have "las calles son barridas los
jueves". For the house example, "the house was built last year", we have "la
casa fue construida el año pasado".


## Constructions

I compiled my own list of useful constructions outside of tenses. These help
get you from sentences like, "the apple is red," to, "I just finished cutting
the apple".

| English | Formula | Example | Translation |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| can | present of poder | puedo ir | i can go |
| may (present) | a lo mejor + present | a lo mejor voy | maybe i will go |
| may (subjunctive) | quizá(s), tal vez + subjunctive | quizá vaya | i may go |
| could | conditional of poder | podría ir | i could go |
| should | conditional of deber | debería ir | i should go |
| must | present of deber | debo ir | i must go |
| shall | future of deber | deberé ir | i shall go |
| usually | present of soler | suelo ir | i usually go |
| used to usually | imperfect of soler | solía ir | i used to usually go |
| become/get | ponerse + adj | me puse cansado | i got tired |
| I'm supposed to... | se supone que + conjugated verb | se supone que voy | i'm supposed to go |
| managed to, ended up | llegar a + infinitive | llegué a ir | i managed to go |
| started to | ponerse a + infinitive | se puse a ir | i started to go |
| about to | estar a punto de + infinitive | estoy a punto de ir | i'm abt to go |
| "for" | estar por + infinitive | estory por ir | i'm "for" going |
| feel like | tener ganas de | tengo ganas de ir | i feel like going |
| want to | querer | quiero ir | i want to go |
| have to | tener que | tengo que ir | i have to go |
| it's necessary | hace falta + infinitive/noun | hace falta ir | it's necessary to go, going *is needed* |
| someone needs | indirect object pronoun + hace falta + infinitive/noun | me hace falta ir | i need to go |
| need to | necesitar + infinitive | necesito ir | i need to go |
| i just finished | acabar de | yo acabo de irme | i just left |
| upon/when | al + inf | al irse | upon leaving... |
| still/continuing | seguir... | sigo yendo | i keep going, i'm still going |
| do again | volver a | ups, volví a hacerlo | oops, I did it again |

Here are some more advanced constructions.

| English | Formula | Example | Translation |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| may have | preterite of poder + haber + past perfect | pude haber ido | i may have gone |
| could have | conditional poder + haber + past perfect | podría haber ido | i could have gone |
| would've fut. | conditional haber + past perfect | habría ido | i would have gone |
| should have | conditional deber + haber + past perfect | debería hbr ido | i should have gone |
| should have (alt) | imperfect subjunctive of haber + past participle | hubiera ido | i should have gone |
| if i had | si + imperfect subjunctive of haber + past participle | si hubiera ido | if i had gone |
| must have | present of deber + infinitive of haber + past participle | debo haber ido | i must have gone |


## Vocabulary

After that I tried to apply the same technique to vocabulary. There are a
number of great first sets of words out there. The first thing I found was
Ogden's list of 850 words for Basic English. After that, there's the list of
625 words from Gabriel Wyner's book Fluent Forever. That list focuses on
picturable words.

  - <a href="https://cjohnson318.github.io/assets/docs/list-625.csv">List of 625 words from Fluent Forever</a>

I think Gabriel Wyner's list of 625 words is a great place to start, and the
absolute bare minimum. It covers days, months, numbers, colors, foods, animals,
other basic nouns, and basic verbs and modifiers. For my next set of memorized
terms, I would just drill down into each one of those categories.

A great exercise is writing a little bit every day, summarizing your day, or
telling a short story about something that happened to you, or describing a
thing, and all of its component parts, like a bicycle, or a playground.


## Questions

Along with key verbs and pronouns, question words should be absolutely second
nature. From there, you should be familiar with expressions related to the time
of day, durations, and frequencies to answer question about when. You should be
familiar with prepositions like, inside, under, above, over there, etc. to
answer questions about where. You should be familiar with numbers, and ordinal
terms like, first, second, next to last, etc. to answer questions about how
many. Questions about who and what go back to being able to use pronouns.
Questions about why and how might rely on technical vocabulary, and maybe
hypotheticals, and the subjunctive.


## Conclusion

On your language journey, there's several dimensions that that you need to
balance. You need to know the essential verbs inside and out, in multiple tenses.
You need to know some unfamiliar constructions with reflexive verbs and object
pronouns. On top of all that, you need to acquire a healthy amount of vocabulary,
including regular verbs. Finally, you need to be able to pose and answer simple
questions.

  1. Essential irregular verbs
  2. Conjugation, focusing on present, preterite, and shortcut future
  3. Pronouns, object pronouns, refleive verbs
  4. Verb phrases and idioms
  5. Vocabulary and regular verbs
  6. Questions
