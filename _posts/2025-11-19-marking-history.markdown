I have been reading more history lately, but events get all mushed together
because I have never learned many dates. I started memorizing dates this year
and it makes it easier to contextualize new information. 

I started out by picking one event from each century of the common era. I
tried to spread dates out as much as possible. I ignored the birth and death
dates of famous people and instead tried to pick an important moment in their
life instead, like Shakespeare writing Hamlet in 1600-ish.

  1. Start with a small number of dates.
  2. Pick datets that are spread out.
  3. Tie an individual, to a work/event, to a date.

So what's the value of this? Well, it helps me contextualize history, and it
increases my awareness of what people would have known about at different
points in history. For example, Shakespeare might have been familiar with David
and Mona Lisa, since they were done about a hundred years before Hamlet,
but William Tecumseh Sherman and Ulysses Grant would not have known of Starry
Night. Moreover, when I hear a new date, like Dante's Inferno was written
around 1321, I know that, uh oh, the Black Death peaked in 1350.

Is this reductive? Isn't history much richer and complex than, "In 1492
Columbus sailed the ocean blue"? Sure, this isn't a substitute for inquiry,
it's just a helpful tool.

Instead of walking around with a bunch of fuzzy historical events jostling
around in a grab bag with only a gernal sense of order, having memorized dates
gives me more of a tapestery with crisp events and I can sew new events into it
as needed.

This is how I started off, but I encourage you to make your own list that is
meaningful to you.
