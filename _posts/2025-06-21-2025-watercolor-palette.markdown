I organize my palette into a chromatic area of strong, bright, mostly
transparent colors, and an area of cave painting colors. I really like the
Daniel Smith brand of paints. They have a very broad selection of intense,
single pigment colors, so you know exactly what you're getting.

## Chromatic Palette

This isn't so much of a split primary palette, or a tertiary palette as it is a
collection of strong, bright colors I've learned to use together.

  - Quinacridone Rose - Transparent warm magenta, great for mixing purples with
  warm blues, or caucasian flesh tones with Raw Sienna. Light pink in a wash.
  Part of CMY triad.
  - Pyrole Scarlet - Semi-opaque STOP sign red.
  - Transparent Pyrole Orange - Transparent orange red, great for mixing
  neutrals with blues, or bright oranges with yellows.
  - Quinacridone Gold - Transparent warm gold, rich and deep in mass tone, 
  bright in a wash. Great for mixing realistic neutralized greens.
  - New Gamboge - Semi-opaque warm yellow, another great mixer for greens.
  - Hansa Yellow Light - Transparent slightly cool yellow. Not very strong on
  its own. Mix with Hansa Yellow Light for a middle yellow. Part of CMY triad.
  - Phthalo Green Blue Shade - Very strong, great mixer with yellow for clean
  greens, or Quinacridone Rose for blues, purples, and grays.
  - Phthalo Blue Green Shade - Very strong, mixes bright greens. Part of CMY
  triad.
  - Phthalo Blue Red Shade - Very strong, mixes great purples. I've replaced
  Ultramarine Blue with this blue this year. Neutralizes with Transparent
  Pyrole Orange.
  - Moonglow - Neutralized purple I like to use in ink drawings. Similar mix
  of pigments found in Papermate felt tip pens.

In here, there's the CMY palette of Phthalo Blue Green Shade, Quinacridone
Rose, and Hansa Yellow Light. There's some less less transparent colors like
Pyrole Scarlet and New Gamboge, and there's Quinacridone Gold, which isn't a
chromatic color. It looks like Pyrole Scarlet and Transparent Pyrole Orange
are a little too close together chromatically. I love the mixing possibilites
offered by Transparent Pyrole Orange, and I love it's transparency. I don't
mix with Pyrole Scarlet much at all, but it's a great primary red that I
can't mix from anything else in the palette. Sometimes you just need a good
STOP sign red.

Why are there so many phthalos? I've avoided using Phthalo Blue Red Shade, in
favor of Ultramarine for years, because of Phthalo's drying shift, but I'm over
it. I want to use the sickly strong phthalos, they're more fun in the moment.
I also really enjoy Prussian Blue as a duller alternative to Phthalo Green Blue
Shade. I don't have a purple in this palette, because Quinacridone Rose makes
such great purples with any warm blue. However, I have a Moonglow, which is an
interesting violet neutral color that's fun to use as a wash on ink drawings.

## Grug Palette

If I only had two colors, they would be Indigo and Transparent Red Oxide, these
are my "Ultramarine and Burnt Sienna", but lusher, darker, and stronger. I call
these my cave painting colors, but they're my favorite colors for quick sketches.

Indigo and Transparent Red Oxide, create a range from rich red orange brown, to
chocolate, to walnut, to perfect black, to midnight navy. In a pinch, a very
light wash of Transparent Red Oxide can pass for a skin tone for white folks.
Cerulean Blue Chromium and Raw Sienna that neutralize to a nice midtone gray
that can be pushed cooler towards blue, or warmer towards tan.

I like the Indigo more than Payne's Gray or Netural Tint because it is so blue,
and that gives you a lot of richness and chromatic space before you're fully
neutralized. I really enjoy the Transparent Red Oxide since it's more fluid and
redder than Burnt Sienna.
