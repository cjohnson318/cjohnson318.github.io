## What is EWMA?

A moving average takes a noisy time series and replaces each value with the
average value of a neighborhood about the given value. This neighborhood may
consist of purely historical data, or it may be centered about the given value.
Furthermore, the values in the neighborhood may be weighted using different sets
of weights. Here is an example of an equally weighted three point moving
average, using historical data,

<div>
$$ s_{t} = \dfrac{x_{t-2} + x_{t-1} + x_{t}}{3} $$
</div>

Here, <span>$s_{t}$</span> represents the smoothed signal, and <span>$x_{t}$</span> represents the noisy
time series. In contrast to simple moving averages, an exponentially weighted
moving average (EWMA) adjusts a value according to an exponentially weighted
sum of all previous values. This is the basic idea,

<div>
$$ s_{t} = \alpha x_{t} + (1 - \alpha) s_{t-1} $$
</div>

This is nice because you donâ€™t have to worry about having a three point window
versus a five point window, or worry about the appropriateness of your
weighting scheme. With the EWMA, previous perturbations "remembered", and
"slowly forgotten", by the <span>$s_{t-1}$</span> term in the last equation, whereas with a
window or neighborhood with discrete boundaries, a perturbation is forgotten as
soon as it passes out of the window.

## How do I do this in code?

This code assumes that you have a Pandas DataFrame with a `price` column, and
a `datetime` column. The following code creates two columns, `ewm_12` and
`ewm_26` using the Pandas' `ewm` method, and the `span` argument. This will
create exponential moving averages over 12 and 26 day windows, respectively.

From there, we can calculate the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence curve by
taking the difference of the `ewm_12` and `ewm_26` curves. From there, the MACD
Signal is the 9 day window exponential moving average of the MACD curve.

{% highlight python %}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas
import seaborn

# build mkt dataframe with 'price' and 'datetime' columns

mkt['ewm_12'] = mkt['price'].ewm(span=12).mean()
mkt['ewm_26'] = mkt['price'].ewm(span=26).mean()
mkt['macd'] = mkt['ewm_12'] - mkt['ewm_26']
mkt['macd_signal'] = mkt['macd'].ewm(span=9).mean()
mkt['macd_minus_signal'] = mkt['macd'] - mkt['macd_signal']
{% endhighlight %}

From here, we can plot the `price` curve, and the exponential moving average
curves.

{% highlight python %}
m = mkt[['price', 'ewm_12', 'ewm_26']]
axes = seaborn.lineplot(data=m, color='k')
axes.grid(True)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
plt.savefig('exponential-moving-average.png', dpi=200)
{% endhighlight %}

Here, we can plot the MACD curve, and the difference between the MACD curve and
the MACD Signal curve. One interpretation of this difference is that negative
values suggest a bear market, while positive values suggest a bull market. 

{% highlight python %}
m = mkt[['macd', 'macd_signal', 'macd_minus_signal']]
axes = seaborn.lineplot(data=m, color='k')
axes.grid(True)
plt.axhline(y=0, color='k', linestyle='-')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
plt.savefig('macd-signal.png', dpi=200)
{% endhighlight %}

## Conclusion

By incorporating EWMA and MACD into your technical analysis, you gain valuable
insights into price movements. While not foolproof, these indicators can help
you identify trends, potential reversals, and even trading signals. Remember,
they are just one piece of the puzzle, and a well-rounded trading strategy
considers other factors too.
