These are my notes for getting [HomeHub](https://github.com/surajverma/homehub)
set up on an Ubuntu server at home.

First, `git clone https://github.com/surajverma/homehub.git` and create
`config.yaml` from `config-example.yaml`.

## Install docker compose

Then, since you haven't installed docker compose yet, do all this.

{% highlight console %}
sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin
{% endhighlight %}

## Try installing docker compose again

Okay, that didn't work, try this,

{% highlight console %}
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release -y
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin
{% endhighlight %}

## Host HomeHub

Run the docker container,

{% highlight console %}
sudo docker compose up -d
{% endhighlight %}

From another terminal, run `ip a` to find the IP address of your linux machine
on the network. Then on a browser, go to that IP address, to port 5000.
