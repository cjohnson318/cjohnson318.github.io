This post collects some topics that are prerequisites for a masters in
mechanical engineering, namely,

  - CIVE 260 - Statics*
  - CIVE 261 - Dynamics*
  - CIVE 360 - Mechanics of Solids
  - MECH 324 - Dynamics of Machines
  - MECH 325 - Machine Design
  - MECH 337 - Thermodynamics
  - MECH 342 - Fluid Mechanics for Mechanical Engineers
  - MECH 344 - Heat and Mass Transfer

## Statics

Unlike Mechanics of Solids, Statics assumes all objects are rigid. This means
we assume they do not deform or change shape regardless of how much force you
apply.

### Vector Algebra

### Free Body Diagram

These diagrams isolate a structure from the elements around it, and replace
those elements with forces.

The main idea is that you break forces down into their components, according to
your choice of coordinate system, and then solve for those forces so that the
sum of the forces and the sum of the moments are equal to zero, at a chosen
point.

$ \sum F = 0, \sum M = 0 $

  1. Draw a Working Diagram
  2. Draw a Free Body Diagram, with a positive sign convention
  3. Write equations for Static Equilibrium
  4. Solve for something
