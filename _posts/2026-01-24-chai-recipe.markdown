This is my goto chai recipe right now. This makes 2 servings.

  - 1 T Tokla Tea
  - 1 1/4 C water
  - 1 C milk
  - 4+ green cardamom
  - 3+ clove
  - 3+ pepper corn
  - 1+ star anise
  - 1-2 cinammon strips
  - 1 inch ginger

Grind everything up in a molcjete, or whatever you have. Bring spices to a boil
in water for 2-3 minutes, add the tea, boil for another minute, add milk, bring
to a simmer, strain, and serve.
